Hello folks! This is my project wherein I am trying to integrate a spotify web player to my react application and mimic a music player , My main focus is to design a song recommendation algorithm to which I am open to discussion .


For running this fork/clone it and create a .env file and put in your spotify dev client_id and secret code use this env file in /myapp and in /Server level. 


For React application you need to define it as REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID and REACT_APP_CLIENT_SECRET

Enjoy ! ;)
